// hoisting: it is javascripts default behaviour to move all the declarations to the top.
// variables declared as var are hoisted and initialised with undefined but the ones declared with let and const are also hoisted but are not initialised.
// temporal dead zone: A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.
